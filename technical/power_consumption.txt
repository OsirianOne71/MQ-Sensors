**POWER CONSUMPTION AND BATTERY LIFE**
1. Raspberry Pi Zero W:
Estimated the Pi Zero W's power usage at approximately 0.35 to 0.4 Watts due to the 5-second sleep cycle and 500kHz SPI. This is a good average for a low-activity, intermittent workload on a Zero W.

2. Sensor 1:   MQ7   carbonmonoxide sensor
Power consumption: 350 mW (0.35 Watts) / 150mA
Operating on 5V

3. Sensor 2:   MQ135 VOC air quality sensor
Power consumption: ≤950 mW (≤0.95 Watts)
Operating on 5V 

   We'll use the maximum value for the worst-case scenario.

Since the sensors are drawing power continuously, we simply add their power consumption to the average power consumption of the Raspberry Pi Zero W.

4. Resulting Estimated Power Consumption
Raspberry Pi Zero W (average) = 0.4 W
Sensor 1 = 0.35 W    MQ135 VOC air quality sensor
Sensor 2 = 0.95 W    MQ7   carbonmonoxide sensor 
Total Power = Pi Zero W + Sensor 1 + Sensor 2
Total Power = 0.4 W + 0.35 W + 0.95 W
Total Power = 1.7 Watts

Therefore, your system, with the Raspberry Pi Zero W operating in its power-efficient mode and the two continuous sensors, will draw approximately 1.7 Watts of power.

Important Considerations for Battery Life:

Battery Capacity: To estimate battery life, you'll need the capacity of your battery in Watt-hours (Wh) or Milliampere-hours (mAh) and its voltage. If it's mAh, convert it to Wh by: Wh = (mAh * V) / 1000.

Voltage Conversion Efficiency: If your battery voltage is different from 5V (e.g., a 3.7V LiPo battery), you'll need a DC-DC converter. These converters are not 100% efficient (typically 85-95%). You'll need to account for this loss when calculating actual battery life. For example, if your battery provides 3.7V and you use a 90% efficient converter to get 5V, the actual power drawn from the battery will be slightly higher: 1.7 W / 0.90 = ~1.89 Watts.

Peak Currents: While your average power is low, keep in mind that the Pi Zero W might have brief current spikes during boot or when Wi-Fi/Bluetooth is very active. Ensure your power supply (battery and converter) can handle these peak demands.
